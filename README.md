This project is the WebApp of my Plongeoir Project for Cardiweb. You can find the Back-Office [here](https://github.com). <br/>

First, clone the project on your device using `git clone`. <br/>

Then go in the folder and download the packages needed using `npm install`. It will go through the package.json and find all the librairies needed for the project to run. <br/>

Finally, you can run the project with `npm start`. The app will launch itself after a few seconds on your browser.
